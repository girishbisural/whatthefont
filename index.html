        <h1>Party in the USA</h1>
        <p>I hopped off the plane at LAX</p>
        <p>With a dream and my cardigan</p>
        <p>Welcome to the land of fame excess (woah)</p>
        <p>Am I gonna fit in?</p>
        <p>Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time</p>
        <p>Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign</p>
        <p>This is all so crazy</p>
        <p>Everybody seems so famous</p>
        <p>My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick</p>
        <p>Too much pressure and I'm nervous</p>
        <p>That's when the taxi man turned on the radio</p>
        <p>And a Jay-Z song was on</p>
        <p>And a Jay-Z song was on</p>
        <p>And a Jay-Z song was on</p>
        <p>So I put my hands up</p>
        <p>They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away</p>
        <p>I'm noddin' my head like, yeah</p>
        <p>Movin' my hips like, yeah</p>
        <p>I got my hands up, they're playin' my song</p>
        <p>They know I'm gonna be okay</p>
        <p>Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.</p>
        <p>Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.</p>
